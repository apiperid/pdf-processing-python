# pdf-processing-python
In this repository i provide python scripts which help the processing of a pdf file.To be more specific you the scripts are about pdf encryption,decryption,merging,splitting and also there is a script which can turn every pdf file into images (this is about to save disk space if you want).
It is kwown that all the above can be done using software (e.g PDFSamBasic) or online tools , but with these .py files there is no need for extra software or upload to internet (which can be dangerous if it is about personal data).
